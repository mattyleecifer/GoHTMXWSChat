#GoHTMXChat

This project started [from the gorilla/websocket chat example](https://github.com/gorilla/websocket/tree/main/examples/chat) and expanded from there. The original aim was to convert it into an HTMX-only chat app that would allow anyone to start secure pseudoanonymous group chats.

Features:
- Like any other chat app, you can send and receive messages.


Todo:
- Add ability to change name
